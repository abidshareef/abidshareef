- 👋 Hi, I’m @abidshareef
-  I build systems that scale and ideas that ship.

I’m an engineer who thinks in **first principles**, designs for **leverage**, and builds for **impact**.  
I don’t just write code — I design systems that survive reality.

 🧠 Philosophy

- Simplicity is a feature, not a compromise  
- Abstractions must earn their existence  
- Automation beats repetition  
- Code is temporary, architecture is destiny  
- If it doesn’t scale, it’s a prototype

⚙️ What I Do

- Design and build scalable backend systems
- Architect clean, maintainable software
- Turn vague ideas into production-ready products
- Automate workflows and eliminate inefficiency
- Think deeply about tradeoffs (then choose fast)

🛠️ Tech Stack (tools change, principles don’t)

**Languages:**  
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, SQL

**Backend:**  
Node.js, FastAPI, Django, REST, GraphQL

**Frontend:**  
React, Next.js, TailwindCSS

**Infra / DevOps:**  
Docker, Linux, CI/CD, Nginx, Cloud (AWS/GCP), Terraform

**Data:**  
PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

**Mindset:**  
Systems thinking, first principles, ruthless prioritization

🚀 Current Focus

- Building high-leverage software
- Designing resilient architectures
- Exploring AI-driven systems
- Compounding skills that matter long-term

 📈 How I Measure Progress

- Less code, more capability
- Fewer bugs, clearer systems
- Faster execution, better decisions
- Real users, real impact

 🤝 Collaboration

I enjoy working with people who:
- Think clearly
- Ship consistently
- Respect craft
- Hate waste

If that’s you, we’ll get along.
